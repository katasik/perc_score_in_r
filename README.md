## Developing an R script to process the PERC (growth-mindset behavioral task's) score

[Porter et al. (2020)](https://learning-analytics.info/index.php/JLA/article/view/6759/7420) developed a behavioral measure assessing growth mindset mastery behaviors at scale (persistence, effort, resilience and challenge-seeking). To create the final PERC score, they provided an SPSS code on [OSF](https://osf.io/8xcjp/) for processing the results. Based on the SPSS code, I developed a script in R to process the results. I used the data provided by Porter et al. (2020) to make sure I calculated the same score as they did. Furthermore, while writing the script, I consulted with the first author of the paper, to make sure the exact same script was developed.

Here is a [video](PERC: Measuring Persistence, Effort, Resilience, and Challenge-seeking), uploaded by Brainology IES about how the PERC task works.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56645248/185787127-cf6dc5b5-52b6-4bde-bf69-e4fd8b3ab7e7.png)
